When Judge Henry Scott dies of a similar wound, Brackenreid suddenly recognizes the work of a murderer long thought dead -- and that he himself might be next on the killer's list. The case deeply divides Murdoch and Brackenreid, each pursuing their own line of investigation. But, a grisly new development in Pollack's murder tells Murdoch that he's been trying to solve this puzzle without all the pieces.",

Despite mounting evidence of the spirit world, Murdoch remains determined to use scientific means to solve the case. Sure enough, evidence starts to stack up against Sarah’s little toady, Lisgar Gall. But when Murdoch accuses Gall of killing Ida in order to protect Sarah, he winds up in the middle of an unexpected lovers’ triangle that further complicates the case.",

As if things weren’t complicated enough, Murdoch discovers a secret room off Virgil’s office – obviously designed for seduction.

As the evidence mounts, it seems increasingly apparent that Hartley was killed in an initiation hazing gone wrong. Sure enough, the team’s coach admits that Hartley would have cost them a spot at the Olympics, so he instructed the boys to put him out of action so they could bring Briggs back. When things got rough, Hartley panicked and ran into the lake – but he was a strong swimmer; they never dreamed he’d drown.

                "overview" : "Murdoch and Crabtree are assigned to protect Prince Alfred during his visit to Toronto.  But, on the very night that British Aid David Jennings warns the authorities about a possible Irish threat against the Prince, an Irish girl wearing a Brotherhood ring turns up dead.  A tattoo on her shoulder is found to be covering another - the symbol of the Brotherhood; and a cipher found in her stomach is believed to hold the key to a plot against the Prince.  In a town where Irish ire continues to fester against the constabulary, not even his good friend Eddie Cullen will help Murdoch in the case. In a race against the clock, Murdoch must track down the girl's killer and decipher the secret message before the insidious Brotherhood can carry out its deadly plan.",

Gaston's observations could have had something to do with his demise, but a letter on his desk from Rouge Valley Lands Ltd. suggests that the reason for his death is decidedly more terrestrial. According to head honcho, Terrence Meyers, RVL had been trying to buy up the valley in order to build an electrical generating station. Gaston was the only hold-out - a sure incentive to get rid of him. Still stymied by Gaston's murder, and ordered to cease his investigation of RVL, Murdoch finally witnesses what Gaston had been writing about - a light in the sky, and a shape emerging over the cornfield. As quickly as it appears, it's gone - but, with the help of Gaston's journals, Murdoch vows to track it down. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Murdoch remains sure that the strange events are all related to the land sale. What he doesn't know is that this threat is much more menacing than any Martian invasion.",

Dr. Grace determines that the Emily did not drown, as they had initially suspected, but was strangled by someone with a very large hand. Constable Crabtree thinks he knows what's happened after he finds that Jeremiah is officially dead - he's now a Haitian zombie, risen from the dead.

Sarah was being treated by Julia Ogden for arachnophobia and had been making some progress in overcoming her fears. Murdoch however finds a dead spider in her room. The three remaining members of the treatment group begin to have their doubts about their therapy. Julia's colleague, Dr. Charles Linden, thinks her therapy is a waste of time and as far as he is concerned, Sarah's death proves him correct. He launches a formal complaint to have her research terminated. When her other patients are forced to face their phobias, Murdoch concludes that someone is trying to kill her patients.

Through it all, Murdoch and his colleagues continue to solve the unsolvable, coming face-to-face with everything from an impossible bank robbery to a threat to destroy Canada, confronting each case with wit, wisdom and innovation. The team also welcomes a new addition, Rebecca James, a recent arrival in Toronto and young woman of humble origins who Dr. Ogden takes under her wing.\n\nSeason nine upholds the series' tradition of bringing historical figures to Toronto, including the likes of Mark Twain, Lucy Maud Montgomery and Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier.",

From a murder involving the Olympic Champion Canadian soccer team, an investigation into a man wrongfully jailed, the introduction of H.P.

It seems the victim, Ida Winston – a member of a paranormal watchdog group – had not been convinced of Sarah’s abilities, which makes Murdoch wonder if Sarah killed Ida because she was about to be revealed as a fraud. Despite mounting evidence of the spirit world, Murdoch remains determined to use scientific means to solve the case. Sure enough, evidence starts to stack up against Sarah’s little toady, Lisgar Gall. But when Murdoch accuses Gall of killing Ida in order to protect Sarah, he winds up in the middle of an unexpected lovers’ triangle that further complicates the case.",
