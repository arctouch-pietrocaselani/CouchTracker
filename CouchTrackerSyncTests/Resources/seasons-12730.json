But now council is considering a new form of electricity called alternating current (AC). So Pratt – and a team of high-powered supporters –decides to mount ‘dog and pony’ shows across the city to prove that AC is a killer. But when Miss Toronto Electric & Light, Alice Howard, is electrocuted in a demonstration gone wrong, it’s determined that the switch handle she pulled had been purposely booby-trapped. In a case that’s further complicated by bribery, scandal and dirty backroom dealings, Murdoch must find out who killed Alice – and why.",

According to his wife, Clara, Percy had gone to a meeting with his business partner, Dr. Gilbert Birkins, but based on the condition of his body, he died just 36-48 hours ago - which leaves five days unaccounted for. When Judge Henry Scott dies of a similar wound, Brackenreid suddenly recognizes the work of a murderer long thought dead -- and that he himself might be next on the killer's list. The case deeply divides Murdoch and Brackenreid, each pursuing their own line of investigation. But, a grisly new development in Pollack's murder tells Murdoch that he's been trying to solve this puzzle without all the pieces.",

It seems the victim, Ida Winston – a member of a paranormal watchdog group – had not been convinced of Sarah’s abilities, which makes Murdoch wonder if Sarah killed Ida because she was about to be revealed as a fraud. Despite mounting evidence of the spirit world, Murdoch remains determined to use scientific means to solve the case. Sure enough, evidence starts to stack up against Sarah’s little toady, Lisgar Gall. But when Murdoch accuses Gall of killing Ida in order to protect Sarah, he winds up in the middle of an unexpected lovers’ triangle that further complicates the case.",

As suspicion turns to Braxton, the investigation takes an unexpected twist when the pathology report turns up evidence that Wendell was homosexual – which leads Brackenreid to conclude that it was Wendell’s lover who wielded the weapon that killed him.

It turns out that the matches were fixed - just like Harry said - and the detectives seem to be closing in on the case.

                "overview": "A skeletal corpse that falls from the ceiling of the Grand theatre is identified as Virgil Smart. His widow, Stella, now runs the theatre with her new husband and a small troupe, including a pretty young actress and her fiancé – each of whom reports that Virgil had been found slumped over his desk, dead of heart failure. Stella insists her husband was buried at a proper funeral. But if this corpse is Virgil’s, then whose body did she bury? It seems that honour went to an out-of-work actor named Eddie. As if things weren’t complicated enough, Murdoch discovers a secret room off Virgil’s office – obviously designed for seduction. Could these murders be the result of a lover’s quarrel, a jealous husband, or a spurned lover? One thing is for certain: Each of these well-rehearsed actors knows what happened that night – and now Murdoch knows just how to trip them up.",

According to his fiancée, Minerva Fairchild, Hartley had just replaced the team’s top rower Horace Briggs, who admits he’d been disappointed when he was bumped from the team – but not enough to kill. As the evidence mounts, it seems increasingly apparent that Hartley was killed in an initiation hazing gone wrong. Sure enough, the team’s coach admits that Hartley would have cost them a spot at the Olympics, so he instructed the boys to put him out of action so they could bring Briggs back. When things got rough, Hartley panicked and ran into the lake – but he was a strong swimmer; they never dreamed he’d drown. Still no closer to the truth, Murdoch orders a test on the water in Hartley’s lungs – and that’s when the investigation finally blows wide open.",

When the police show up at the crime scene, the victim’s son Harcourt – a ventriloquist – is found hiding in the closet with his look-alike dummy Mycroft. Even more disturbing than the similarity, is the roiling bond between the two – much like hostile brothers.  Although Harcourt confesses to the murder, Murdoch spots inconsistencies in the story that make no sense – unless there was a third party involved.  Harcourt had been in the room when Roddy was killed. He would have seen the killer, but why is he protecting his identity?  In a shocking turn, Murdoch learns that Harcourt has a twin brother named Mycroft.  Maybe Mycroft killed Roddy; and Harcourt is protecting him.  But just when it looks like the case is solved, Murdoch sees something in a Grimesby family photo that puts a whole new twist on things.",

Although the scene suggests he was trampled by horses on their way to the rendering vats, the blow to the back of Rookwood's head was not caused by a horse's hoof. When a short-handled shovel wielded by someone child-sized is finally determined to be the murder weapon, suspicion turns to the boys who work at the glue factory – and one young boy in particular, Charlie, who turns out to be the long-lost brother of Rookwood's adopted daughter, Eva. As evidence starts to stack up against Charlie, Murdoch learns that Rookwood's disgruntled ex-valet had long been receiving hush money from his former boss for keeping a secret – one so repugnant that it would drive anyone to murder.",

Things start to look worse for Greyson when a reaper’s costume is found stashed away in his office.  Despite how things look, though, Murdoch knows Greyson’s not their man.

Gaston's observations could have had something to do with his demise, but a letter on his desk from Rouge Valley Lands Ltd. suggests that the reason for his death is decidedly more terrestrial. According to head honcho, Terrence Meyers, RVL had been trying to buy up the valley in order to build an electrical generating station. Gaston was the only hold-out - a sure incentive to get rid of him. Still stymied by Gaston's murder, and ordered to cease his investigation of RVL, Murdoch finally witnesses what Gaston had been writing about - a light in the sky, and a shape emerging over the cornfield. As quickly as it appears, it's gone - but, with the help of Gaston's journals, Murdoch vows to track it down. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Murdoch remains sure that the strange events are all related to the land sale. What he doesn't know is that this threat is much more menacing than any Martian invasion.",

No one has reported a murder yet, but using the model’s intricate clues left by Lydia, Murdoch discovers that someone indeed has been killed – but what happened and why? Someone is far from happy by his investigations and things begin to get even more sinister in the neighbourhood.",

The Keewatin is about to depart from Toronto on its maiden voyage destined for Rochester, N.Y. and Murdoch thinks they should stay on board, especially after he sees that Julia is one of the invited guests. Their presence proves useful after MacFarlane's daughter Amy, who is engaged to her father's chief financial officer Owen Mathers, falls overboard and is nowhere to be found. As Murdoch investigates he finds there is a real threat against the Keewatin and the true facts behind Amy's disappearance.",

Sarah was being treated by Julia Ogden for arachnophobia and had been making some progress in overcoming her fears. Murdoch however finds a dead spider in her room. The three remaining members of the treatment group begin to have their doubts about their therapy. Julia's colleague, Dr. Charles Linden, thinks her therapy is a waste of time and as far as he is concerned, Sarah's death proves him correct. He launches a formal complaint to have her research terminated. When her other patients are forced to face their phobias, Murdoch concludes that someone is trying to kill her patients. Meanwhile, Crabtree tries to save his pet spider from Dr. Grace's experiments and Dr. Ogden helps Murdoch overcome his own irrational fear.",

                "overview": "Detective Murdoch investigates the death of Katie Buchanan who is found dead at the beach, on a hot summer's day, by her friend Elaine Lawson. Both were entrants in a beauty pageant known as the Miss Purity competition, to select the new face of Alexander soap. Dr. Ogden, who is spending her day off at the beach finds what appears to be a large animal bite on the woman's torso. Katie's boyfriend, James Bennett, had recently left her for another competitor, Marie Nicholson and becomes the prime suspect. Inspector Brackenreid however is certain he saw a monster in Lake Ontario and Murdoch is skeptical until he too sees a creature in the water. Constable Crabtree is dismissive of any suggestion that there might be a monster in the water and pursues a more realistic line of inquiry.",

They believe both the victim and his killer are from Newfoundland and so Murdoch and Crabtree head off to St. John's in the hopes of finding the suspected killer Ezekiel Farrelly. Crabtree was actually raised in St. John's by several aunts who, it turns out, have an interesting occupation. The solution to murder lies with finding an old pirate treasure map.",

Both come under suspicion when the police find a dead man, Dennis Bolton who was released from the Don jail just a week ago. There's no direct connection between Bolton and Gillies but both were in the same jail at the same time. As tensions rise, it becomes evident that Gillies has arranged for several ex-convicts to be on the train - all part of his plan to escape.",

Dr. Emily Grace determines that he died in the early hours of the morning from a blow to the head causing a subdural hemorrhage. The evidence in the case begins to point to one of the Jubilee Singers as the perpetrator. Much to George Crabtree's chagrin, Emily seems to have taken an interest in the roguish Leslie Garland. Julia meanwhile feels that a huge weight has been taken off her shoulders now that James Gillian is dead.",

Through it all, Murdoch and his colleagues continue to solve the unsolvable, coming face-to-face with everything from an impossible bank robbery to a threat to destroy Canada, confronting each case with wit, wisdom and innovation. The team also welcomes a new addition, Rebecca James, a recent arrival in Toronto and young woman of humble origins who Dr. Ogden takes under her wing.\n\nSeason nine upholds the series' tradition of bringing historical figures to Toronto, including the likes of Mark Twain, Lucy Maud Montgomery and Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier.",

Following the opener, Murdoch and the rest of Station Four find themselves embroiled in cases both fantastical and historical. From a murder involving the Olympic Champion Canadian soccer team, an investigation into a man wrongfully jailed, the introduction of H.P. Lovecraft (the master of the macabre), a wronged woman who goes on a serial killing spree, to the death of a prize pooch at a dog show, there is very little rest for Murdoch, Ogden, Brackenreid, Crabtree, James and the rest of Station Four. And as all this goes on, Murdoch tries to deliver on his promise to his wife and build her the home of her dreams. Or is it his nightmare? No matter what changes the future holds, Murdoch and the team will be there to solve each fresh mystery with tenacity and ingenuity.",
